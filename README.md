Converting Telegram stickers to WhatsApp

Bot description:
Send one sticker to this bot, and it will download the entire sticker pack that contains this sticker and convert it into a format for WhatsApp. 
To import a sticker pack into WhatsApp, you will need the “Sticker Maker” program, which is available for free in the AppStore and PlayMarket.
Please note that only regular and video stickers are supported (animated ones are not supported)

You will need to install «FFmpeg» on your machine, if you want this bot to be able to convert video stickers!
